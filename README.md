# Hi - I'm Manas Kalangan

Seeking Full-Time Software Engineer roles starting January 2025. I partner with product and engineering teams to ship reliable backend services and automation that move business metrics - not just code. Check out my [portfolio](https://manas-droid.github.io/)

## About Me 
- Product-driven engineer with 2+ years of hands-on experience delivering backend systems, infra automation, and developer productivity improvements.
- Proven impact: reduced operational escalations by ~30%, accelerated slow test suites by up to 90%, and remediated thousands of production defects.
- Comfortable owning the end-to-end lifecycle: requirements → design → implementation → monitoring → iteration

## Contributions 
Check out [my open-source commits](https://github.com/Ginger-Automation/Ginger/commits?author=manas-droid) to Ginger (automation testing tool)

## Projects
[ArtAtlas](https://github.com/manas-droid/ArtAtlas) - _Explainable Hybrid Art Search Engine_
- Designed and built a local-first, explainable retrieval system in Python that cleanly separates candidate retrieval, result ordering, and evidence-based explanation into independently auditable layers.
- Implemented hybrid search using PostgreSQL FTS and vector embeddings (pgvector), augmented with a human-curated concept layer to ensure deterministic behavior without opaque LLM reasoning.
- Built runtime Evidence Bundles and a validated Explanation Graph to attach explanations only when supported by traceable evidence, without blocking or distorting retrieval results.

 
 [News Feed Service](https://github.com/manas-droid/System-Design-Interview-Practice/tree/main/tiny-news-feed-service) - _Twitter-like Timeline Service_
- Designed and implemented a scalable news feed service, modeling Twitter-style timelines with a hybrid fan-out strategy to efficiently support both normal users and high-follower users.
- Implemented an asynchronous write pipeline that persists posts and offloads fan-out processing to Kafka consumers.
- Developed a read-optimized feed service that merges Redis inboxes with the pulled posts from high-follower users.

## Highlights

- Reduced production escalations by ~30% by designing and deploying reliable, fault-tolerant .NET 8 services (Rocket Mortgage)
- Accelerated test suites by up to 90% by optimizing automation workflows within the open-source Ginger testing framework.
- Resolved 3,000+ production defects & 300 critical bugs, strengthening reliability and customer trust
- Increased product quality and release confidence by boosting UI & automation test coverage by 60% (Selenium & MSTest)
- OCR & docs - Redesigned OCR pipeline to improve PDF text clarity by ~40% (Amdocs testing feature)

## Systems & technical scope 

- Languages & frameworks: C#, .NET (Web API/ASP.NET MVC), Node.js/Express, TypeScript, React, Python
- Data & storage: SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
- Cloud & infra: AWS Lambda, Terraform, Azure DevOps
- Testing & observability: MSTest, Selenium, automated test optimization, logging & metrics-driven rollouts

## Education
**M.S. in Computer Science**, University at Buffalo · Expected May 2026
